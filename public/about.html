<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Salah Eddin Kanaya — a passionate and driven programmer with a solid foundation in software engineering and hands-on experience building complex applications. I'm currently studying <em>Innovative Programming</em> at Linköping University, where I've worked on diverse projects spanning web development, mobile apps, databases, and system-level programming.</p>
<p>Over the years, I've challenged myself through a wide range of real-world projects using technologies like Java, C#, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python, along with frameworks such as React, Node.js, and .NET. I've built everything from front-end interfaces to full-stack systems and REST APIs.</p>
<p>I love writing clean, scalable code and collaborating with teams using GitLab and testing frameworks. In short: I don't just write code — I solve problems with it. Let me show you what I can do.</p>
